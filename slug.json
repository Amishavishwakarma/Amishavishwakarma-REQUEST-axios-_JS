Agar nahi, to apni responsibilities kisi existing Council member ko handover karke jaana. Agar koi Council member wo responsibilities nahi nibha ke liye taiyaar nahi hota to Electios ke results ko revisite karna padega aur jis nominated member ko 2nd highest votes mile the, wo member temporarily us profile ki responsibility le sakta hai\\n* Absence for > 14 days: Uss profile ke liye re-elction kiye jayenge\\n\\n\\n Agar koi bhi Council member apni responsibility kisi ko handover kiye bina campus se jaata hai to usse resignation maanga jayega. Wo aage aane wale elections me participate nahi kar payenge. \"}]",
